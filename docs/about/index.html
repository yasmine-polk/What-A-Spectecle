        <p id="Bio">Yasmine Polk is a reclusive storyteller currently 
         residing in Chicago, Illinois, who spends much
        of her time exploring any outlet of visual stories
        that so interest her. She mostly writes
        psychological thrillers but she also often dabbles 
        in other genres such as drama, mystery and 
        fantasy. When she is not stimulating her need 
        for a good story, she can usually be found sleeping or spening time with family and friends.

        <p id="why">I write because it keeps me sane. Sometimes the words I wish I could say leave my brain to enter my veins where they mix with my blood to become ink and with the assistance of a pen I bleed my ideals, my thoughts, my dreams, into reality. Words are my divine. They are both my vice and my virtue. They are the very root that drives me and with them there is nothing I can hide. No story that I can’t tell. Worlds that only I have been to, realities that only exist within me, people that only I have met. It is through these words that I plan to make other people see. 
           <p id="happy"> I write because it’s what I feel I was designed to do. It’s the only way I can truly express myself. Words are my greatest escape, my closest friend. I am a writer because I allow those words to embrace me. I have a talent of somehow mending them poetically, of bringing characters to life, of making an audience feel what I want them to feel. I am a writer because I put myself into my work. I put part of my soul into every page. I am a writer because I have so many stories to tell. </p>
